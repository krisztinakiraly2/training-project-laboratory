This GitHub repository showcases my Training Project Laboratory work, which is connected to my studies at BME. 
The completed project features a tic-tac-toe game. Upon startup, the user is greeted with a menu, where the game can be started by pressing a button.  
The game is played between two players, each aiming to be the first to align four identical elements in a row, column, or diagonal. When the goal is 
met, a message above the board indicating the game's outcome. Players can restart the game using the clear button or return to the menu with the menu button.
